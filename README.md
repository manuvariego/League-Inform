# Project Overview

This is a simple discord bot project, the bot receives data from the riot api, analyzes it, and returns the simplified data back to the player (Ex: Won 'x' matches out of 'n'). 

## Project Scope 

For the forseeable future there is no predefined project scope, it will probably stay within the bounds of match analysis and statistics. 

## Usage

Run the `make` command while in the projects root directory, or navigate to the `/cmd` directory and run `go run main.go`
